    <h1>About JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    
    <h1>What is JavaScript ?</h1>
    <p  style="font-size: large;">JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
   
    <h1>Advantages of JavaScript</h1>
    <ul  style="font-size: large;">
        <h3>The merits of using JavaScript are :</h3>

Less server interaction <li> You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

Immediate feedback to the visitors</li><li>They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

Increased interactivity </li><li> You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

Richer interfaces </li><li> You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
    </ul>
    <h1>Limitations of JavaScript</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <h3>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features :</h3>

<li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. </li><li>This has been kept for security reason.</li>

<li>JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.</li><li>

JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Extra points:</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It allows you to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and enhance the user experience of web pages. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and can also be used for server-side development using frameworks like Node.js.</li>
        <li>Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's browser. It enables dynamic manipulation of HTML content, handling user interactions, and performing various tasks without requiring a round trip to the server.</li>
        <li>Syntax and Features: JavaScript has a syntax similar to other programming languages like C, Java, and C++. It supports variables, data types (such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects), operators, control structures (such as if statements, loops), functions, and more.</li>
        <li>DOM Manipulation: JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML or XML document. It allows you to manipulate and modify the content, structure, and styling of web pages dynamically. You can add, remove, or modify HTML elements, change CSS styles, handle events, and update page content on the fly.</li>
        <li>Event Handling: JavaScript provides mechanisms to handle user interactions, such as clicks, mouse movements, form submissions, and keyboard events. You can attach event handlers to specific HTML elements and define JavaScript functions to be executed when events occur.</li>
    </ul>
