        <h1>SQL:
        </h1>
        <h1>CSS_Overview</h1>
        <p>SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc. SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard language, but there are many different versions of the SQL language.</p>
        <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
        <p>SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.

            SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.</p>
        
        <h2>Some Others Points:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Database Management: SQL is used to manage relational databases, which are organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. It provides a set of commands 
            for creating, modifying, and querying databases, tables, and their data.</li>
        <li>Data Manipulation: SQL allows you to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from a database. The common SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM, and more.</li>
        <li>Data Definition: SQL can define the structure and properties of the database objects. It includes commands like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE to create, modify, and remove tables,
             columns, indexes, and constraints.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>PHP:</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”. 

        Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf 
        unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.</p>
      <h2>Why should we use PHP?</h2>
      <p>PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails, etc.
         There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt users data which makes PHP secure and reliable 
        to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of PHPs abilities that make it suitable to be used as a server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in further tutorials. 
        Even if the above abilities do not convince you of PHP, there are some more features of PHP. PHP can run on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. Almost all of the major servers available today like Apache supports PHP. PHP allows using a wide range of databases.
         And the most important factor is that it is
         free to use and download and anyone can download PHP from its official source: www.php.net. </p>
    <h2>Some Other Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Server-Side Scripting: PHP is primarily used as a server-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the server before being sent to the client's browser. It can generate dynamic HTML content, interact with databases, handle forms, and perform various server-side tasks</li>
        <li>Database Connectivity: PHP provides built-in extensions and functions to connect to and interact with databases using SQL. It supports multiple database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.</li>
        <li>Query Execution: PHP can execute SQL queries and retrieve the results from the database. It provides functions to establish a database connection, prepare and execute SQL statements, fetch and process query results, and handle errors.</li>
        <li>Dynamic Web Applications: PHP allows you to build dynamic web applications by combining SQL and HTML. You can use SQL queries within PHP code to retrieve data from a database, process it, and generate dynamic content for web pages.</li>
     
    </ul>
