<h2>1.Define DNS. Explain about web server operations in detail.</h2>

<p id="demo1">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses. It enables users to access websites using human-readable names. A web server receives client requests and processes them. It handles static content by retrieving files and sending them as responses. For dynamic content, it passes the request to an application server, generates the content, and communicates with databases or services. The server constructs an HTTP response, sends it to the client, and closes the connection. Web servers also have additional features like load balancing and security measures."'>show answer!</button>

<br><br><h2>2.Differentiate between SMTP & POP protocols. Explain about web server.</h2>

<p id="demo2">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "SMTP is for sending outgoing email messages from a client to a server, while POP is for retrieving email messages from a server to a client. A web server delivers websites and web applications over the internet, handling client requests, processing content, and sending HTTP responses. It serves static content directly and uses application servers or scripts for dynamic content. Web servers also handle tasks like compression, caching, and security measures."'>show answer!</button>

<br><br><h2>3.What tag is used to define a link and explain its attributes with example?</h2>

<p id="demo3">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "The <a> tag is used to define a link (also known as an anchor) in HTML. It allows you to create clickable links that direct users to another webpage, a specific section within the same page, or other resources.The <a> tag has several attributes that can be used to modify the behavior and appearance of the link."'>show answer!</button>

<br><br><h2>5.What is the purpose of style sheets? What is the advantage of external style sheets over inline and document-level style sheets?</h2>

<p id="demo5">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = "Style sheets, specifically CSS, are used to control the design and layout of web documents. They allow developers to separate the visual presentation from the structure and content of a webpage.

<br><br><h2>6.Explain CSS box model with an appropriate example? What is the purpose of class selector?</h2>

<p id="demo6">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = "The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes the structure and layout of elements on a web page. It consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. The purpose of the box model is to define the spacing and dimensions of an element.The purpose of the class selector is to provide a way to group and target specific elements for styling. It enables developers to create reusable styles that can be applied to different elements, promoting consistency and efficiency in styling. By using the class selector, developers can easily apply the same style to multiple elements without the need to repeat the style definition for each element individually."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>7. What do you know about JavaScript DOM? Explain different kinds of dialog boxes.</h2>

<p id="demo7">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = "JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree-like structure. It allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the elements, attributes, and text within a web page."'>show answer!</button>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = "html program is ..."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>9.Why JavaScript is useful in WebPages? Give the difference between Java & JavaScript with examples.</h2>

<p id="demo9">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = "JavaScript is useful in web pages because it enables dynamic and interactive content, client-side form validation, manipulation of the HTML structure and styling through the DOM, asynchronous communication with servers, event handling for user interactions, compatibility across browsers, integration with third-party libraries and frameworks, and the ability to create custom functionality tailored to specific web application needs."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>10.Explain session and cookies with examples.</h2>

<p id="demo10">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo10").innerHTML = "Session: A session is a way to store user data temporarily on the server. When a user visits a website, a unique session ID is assigned, which is stored as a cookie on the users browser. The server then associates this session ID with the users data stored on the server. The session data can include information like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or login status. Sessions are commonly used to maintain stateful interactions between a user and a website throughout their browsing session.Cookies: Cookies are small text files stored on a users browser. They are used to store user-specific information. When a user visits a website, the server sends a cookie to the users browser, which is then stored on their device. The cookie contains data such as user preferences, login credentials, or tracking information. The browser sends the cookie back to the server with subsequent requests, allowing the server to identify and personalize the users experience. Cookies can have an expiration date, allowing them to persist for a specific period or be set as session cookies, which are stored only until the browser is closed."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>11.Write a server side script for user registration having input fields name, password, age, email, phone with a proper client side validation.</h2>

<p id="demo11">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo11").innerHTML = "Here is javascript program......."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>12.Write a PHP program that creates a table “Employee (id, name, department, phone, age, address)” and insert query to insert a new row in that table.</h2>

<p id="demo12">ANS:</p>

<br><br><h1>Shorts Notes</h1>
<h2>13.Array in PHP.</h2>

<p id="demo13">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo13").innerHTML = "In PHP, an array is a data structure that can hold multiple values in a single variable. It can be declared using the array() function or square bracket syntax ([]). Arrays can be indexed or associative, allowing for easy access to elements. Multidimensional arrays are also supported. PHP provides built-in functions for array manipulation, such as sorting and merging. Arrays are commonly used in PHP for storing and processing collections of data."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>14.JavaScript Event.</h2>

<p id="demo14">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo14").innerHTML = "JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a button click, mouse movement, or page load. They allow developers to respond to these events and execute code accordingly. Events in JavaScript enable interactivity and dynamic behavior in web pages. By attaching event handlers to specific elements or the document itself, developers can specify the actions to be performed when events occur. This includes validating form inputs, updating content, making API requests, and much more. JavaScript events play a crucial role in creating interactive and responsive web applications."'>show answer!</button>
<br><br><h2>15.Pattern Matching in PHP.</h2>

<p id="demo15">ANS:</p>

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo15").innerHTML = "Pattern matching in PHP refers to the process of searching for specific patterns within strings or data using regular expressions. Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools that allow developers to define patterns and perform various operations like matching, searching, replacing, and extracting data."'>show answer!</button>

Design a Soccer Player class that includes three integer fields: a players jersey number, number of goals, number of assists and necessary constructors to initialize the data members. Overload the > operator (greater than). One player is considered greater than another if the sum of goals plus assists is greater than that of the others. Create an array of 11 soccer players, then use the overloaded > operator to find the player who has the greatest total of goals plus assists.</li>
