    <h1>HyperText Markup Language (HTML): What It Is, How It Works</h1>
    <h3>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

        Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between smallerthan and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
    <br></p><h3>Understanding HTML</h3><p style="font-size: large;">HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.

    HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>
    
   <h1> HyperText Markup Language Basics:</h1>
   <p style="font-size: large;"> At its core, HTML is a series of short codes typed into a text-file. These are the tags that power HTMLs capabilities. The text is saved as an HTML file and viewed through a web browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, as directed by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering. Writing HTML requires tags to be used correctly to create the authors vision.</p>
    <h1>Some Points Are:</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. It provides the structure and content of a web page, defining how the information is organized and displayed to the user. HTML uses tags to mark up elements within a document, which are then interpreted by web browsers to render the content.</li>
        <li>Structure: HTML documents consist of a series of elements enclosed in tags. Elements can be nested inside each other to create a hierarchical structure. The root </li>
        <li>Tags: HTML tags are used to define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
        <li>Attributes: HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value.</li>
        <li>Validation: HTML markup should adhere to certain rules and standards. Validators can be used to check whether an HTML document follows these standards. The W3C Markup Validation Service is a commonly used validator.</li>
    </ul>
