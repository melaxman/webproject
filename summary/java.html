    <h1>javascript Summary</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;"> <li> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
        <li> It is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary 
            compilation)..</li>
        <li>javaScript is case sensitive..</li>
        <li>JavaScript is object-based language as it provides predefined objects</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It allows you to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and enhance the user experience of web pages. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and can also be used for server-side development using frameworks like Node.js.</li>
        <li>Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's browser. It enables dynamic manipulation of HTML content, handling user interactions, and performing various tasks without requiring a round trip to the server.</li>
        <li>Syntax and Features: JavaScript has a syntax similar to other programming languages like C, Java, and C++. It supports variables, data types (such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects), operators, control structures (such as if statements, loops), functions, and more.</li>
        <li>DOM Manipulation: JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML or XML document. It allows you to manipulate and modify the content, structure, and styling of web pages dynamically. You can add, remove, or modify HTML elements, change CSS styles, handle events, and update page content on the fly.</li>
        <li>Event Handling: JavaScript provides mechanisms to handle user interactions, such as clicks, mouse movements, form submissions, and keyboard events. You can attach event handlers to specific HTML elements and define JavaScript functions to be executed when events occur.</li>
    </ul>
