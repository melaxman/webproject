        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and visual appearance of a document written in HTML or XML. It provides a way to separate the content of a web page from its design, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the page.</li>
        <li>Selectors: CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. Selectors can be based on element types, class names, IDs, attributes, and more. Multiple selectors can be combined to target specific elements.</li>
        <li>Properties and Values: CSS properties define the specific aspects of an element that you want to style, such as color, font, margin, padding, and more. Each property is assigned a value that determines how the property should be applied.</li>
        <li>Cascading and Specificity: CSS follows a set of rules to determine which styles should be applied to an element when multiple styles are defined. The cascade determines the order of importance of styles, while specificity determines which styles take precedence over others.</li>
        <li>Box Model: The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered in terms of content, padding, borders, and margins. It helps control the spacing and layout of elements on a web page.</li>
        <li>Media Queries: Media queries allow developers to apply different styles based on various conditions, such as the screen size or device type. This enables responsive design, where the layout and styles adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
        <li>CSS Frameworks: CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, provide pre-designed CSS components and stylesheets that can be used to speed up the development process and ensure consistent design across different projects.</li>
    </ul>
